## Methodology

In this section, explain the methodology used for the project. Describe the data preparation, cleaning, and transformation steps that were taken. Explain the SQL queries that were used for the analysis, and any assumptions or decisions made during the analysis process.

## Insights

- **Player performance:** The dataset includes a number of player statistics, such as Player Efficiency Rating, True Shooting Percentage, and Win Shares, which can be used to evaluate a player's performance. An executive could use this information to assess the value of different players and make decisions about which players to draft, trade for, or sign to their team.

- **Team performance:** The dataset also includes team statistics, such as Games, Minutes Played, and Win Shares, which can be used to evaluate a team's performance. An executive could use this information to assess the strengths and weaknesses of their own team and of their opponents, and make decisions about which areas to focus on improving.

- **Positional analysis:** The dataset includes information about player positions, which can be used to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different positions. An executive could use this information to identify areas where their team may be lacking in terms of position-specific skills, and make decisions about which players to target in order to address those weaknesses.

- **Player development:** The dataset includes information about player age and experience, which can be used to evaluate a player's potential for development. An executive could use this information to identify young players who may have the potential to improve significantly over time, and make decisions about how to invest in their development.

- Identify the players who have the highest Player Efficiency Rating (PER) in a particular season or over multiple seasons. This can help identify players who are particularly effective on the court and could potentially be valuable additions to a team.

- Determine the most common positions played by players in a particular season or across multiple seasons. This can help teams identify areas where they may be weak or where they may want to focus their recruitment efforts.

- Analyze the correlation between various statistics, such as PER and minutes played, to gain insights into the factors that contribute to a player's success. This can help teams develop better player evaluation models and identify players who may be undervalued by other teams.

- Look at the distribution of player salaries across different positions and teams to determine which positions or teams are paying their players the most or the least. This can help teams evaluate their own salary structures and identify opportunities to adjust their spending.

Identify trends in player performance over time, such as changes in shooting percentages or usage rates. This can help teams identify players who may be improving or declining and adjust their strategies accordingly.
